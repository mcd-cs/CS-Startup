1. Make background transparent while everything else is opaque
2. Stylize the CSS, emulate classic web look - Right now the website looks like a little girl's bedroom, which is fine but not what I was going for
3. Update footer, space everything out
4. Replace favicon and other outdated files
4. Rebrand startup website from current to text adventure, post to domain
