# My Website Project:
[THIS IS STILL VERY MUCH A ROUGH DRAFT AND IT WILL PROBABLY CHANGE VERY SOON.]
Paroxysm, a website/blog dedicated to education and science.

## Authentication:
Users will be able to log in and choose which APIs they want on their page, such as Nasa's Image of the Day, Youtube Statistics, etc. No algorithms, no internet discourse, just the website the way you want it!

## Database
The website will save user preferences based on their usernames and passwords so they can keep their own website theme.

## Websocket
Paroxysm will pull from a bunch of APIs to generate the website's daily content. I'm hoping to use Nasa's APIs, as well as other APIs for things like the weather, calendar events, exact date and time, fun facts of the week, etc. It's going to be focused on finding the fun little tidbits of information that the internet usually forgets about, so I'll be on the lookout for useful APIs.

### HTML
I want to make it easy to develop additional pieces of the website, so I think I'll use a template for each new API I introduce, then combine them based on user preference.
### CSS
I don't like how modern websites look, so I think I'll base this website's design on an older aesthetic like Windows 95 or Frutiger Aero. Something easy to put together but still stylized in it's own way.
### JAVASCRIPT
Most of my javascript code will probably be related to user preferences and getting information from different APIs, but I think that if I can get the main website structure figured out, I'll be able to implement things just fine.

This is a very rough image because I need to get this assignment due before midnight, but this is kind of what I hope it will look like. A page where you can pick and choose widgets that you're interested in, and then customize them to your heart's content!
