# My Website Project:
Paroxysm, a browser-based text adventure.

## Authentication:
Users will be able to log in to return to their place in the game's story, meaning they can pick up the game on any device and keep their progress.

## Database
The website will save user progress based on username and password, as well as a recording of their decisions to see which choices are chosen most often.

## Websocket
Paroxysm will send real-time messages whenever a certain event happens to a user, so you can see whenever another player starts for the first time, restarts, dies, beats the game, or makes any other decision that doesn't spoil the story.

### HTML
The website will have a login screen, a game window, and an about page that are made in HTML.
### CSS
I don't like how modern websites look, so I think I'll base this website's design on an older aesthetic like Windows 95 or Frutiger Aero. Something easy to put together but still stylized in it's own way.
I'll also use CSS to give text animations and styles that I can play with during the game's story.
### JAVASCRIPT
Javascript will be used to parse JSON files containing the game's story, display them in the website's game window, and activate different events based on user choice. Being able to parse JSON means that potentially, users will be able to make their own stories and upload them to the website!

This is a very rough image that is subject to change, but it's the most basic layout I had in mind.
